                    <h3>Template data</h3>
                    <p>The Webpack Handlebars plugin that we use comes with a very handy utility that allows us to pass in JSON files as template data.</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger-faded">What is JSON? Read more here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp</a></div>
                    <p>Please navigate to: <code class="language-markup">src/data</code>. Here is where our template data JSON files reside. You can edit, remove or add your own to this folder. We have organised the JSON files in subfolders, but please note that the subfolders are not required and are not referenced by Handlebars when you output the data. Let's look at what that means. In the "Handlebars Partials" section of these helpdocs, we referenced this example:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                        \{{#each category-three.entries}}
                            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                                \{{> listing-cards/listing-card-one this }}
                            </div>
                        \{{/each}}                
                    </script>
                    <p>The important part here with regards to template data is <code class="language-markup">category-three.entries</code>. What this means is that inside our data folder you will find a JSON file called "category-three". This <code class="language-markup">category-three.json</code> file has a "key" called "entries". Let's say you created a JSON file called "menswear.json", and instead of "entries", you have "shoes". The example above would then be:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                        \{{#each menswear.shoes}}
                            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                                \{{> listing-cards/listing-card-one this }}
                            </div>
                        \{{/each}}                
                    </script>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger-faded">Please note that each time you make a change to your JSON files, you have to restart your Webpack devserver. This is because the data JSON files are passed in when Webpack starts. It does not monitor the files for any changes.</a></div>

                    <h4>Controlling layout partials</h4>
                    <p>Another huge benefit of using our JSON data setup is that we can easily control core layout options for our HTML pages. So instead of having to change the header partial for every single page, most pages can have their header or footer changed from a single line inside the config.json file. Navigate to: <code class="language-markup">src/data/demo-config/config.json</code>. Notice the following code:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                        "partials": {
                            "head": "head/head",
                            "navbar": "navbar-one/navbar-light",
                            "footer": "footer-one/footer-dark"
                        }               
                    </script>
                    <p>This is what controls which header partial is output: <code class="language-markup">"navbar": "navbar-one/navbar-light"</code>. So if you wanted to change to navbar-two, you would amend the code to be:  <code class="language-markup">"navbar": "navbar-two/navbar-light"</code>. Then quick Webpack, restart it, and now your template will display navbar-two as the navbar.</p>
                    <p>Now open up our blank.html page, located here: <code class="language-markup">src/html/blank.html</code>. Around line 9, you will find this code:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                        <!-- Navbar -->
                        \{{> (config config.partials.navbar) 
                        configClassList=config.classes.navbar
                        classList="" }}
                        <!-- / Navbar-->              
                    </script>    
                    <p>This is pulling in the value from our config.json file. Most of the pages (not all, though) have this setup. Only on some of the pages do we override this method. We do this for two reasons: one, so that some of our key pages can showcase our different headers and footers. And two, so that both methods of outputting the header/footer partials are clear to you. This means you can control the header and footer partial from our config.json for all pages but you have the ability to set custom header or footers for specific pages as well.</p>       
                    <p>The reason we have setup the template in this manner is because Handlebars doesn't offer layout functionality that other templating engines such as Nunjucks does. We wanted it to be as easy as possible for our customers to make core layout changes to all pages without the need to open up every single HTML page.</p>
