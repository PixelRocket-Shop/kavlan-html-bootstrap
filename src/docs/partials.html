                    <h3>Handlebars</h3>
                    <p>Handlebars is a template engine that allows us to keep our template source code as organised and as clean as possible. It cuts down on code duplication and through the use of helper functions, allows template developers to very quickly output large amounts of data with minimal code. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">https://handlebarsjs.com/</a></p>
                    <p>It also allows us to pass in JSON data files - you will find a full breakdown of our JSON data files in the next section of these helpdocs, entitled "Template Data".</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-info">Not comfortable working with Handlebars, or prefer to just use HTML? That's fine. Please note that you are not forced to use Handlebars for any customisation you want to make to the template. You are free to make normal HTML changes and to ignore our use of Handlebars.</div>
                    <h4>Why we use Handlebars</h4>
                    <p>We use Handlebars for two main reasons: firstly, the use of Handlebars partials allows us to reference the same file in multiple HTML files and means that you only have to edit the code from a single source. If you're used to working with React or Vue, this would be the same as referencing a component. Secondly, the use of JSON data for our dummy catalogue data keeps our template code clean. We can easily output 10 dummy products on our listing page by outputting a basic Handlebars loop.</p>

                    <h4>Handlebars Partial Example</h4>
                    <p>Let's look at an example. Open the following file in our template:</p>
                    <p><code class="language-markup">src/html/index.html</code></p>
                    <p>Around line 9, you will see this code block:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                        \{{> navbar-one/navbar-light }}                   
                    </script>     
                    <p>That's a Handlebars partial. That code tells Handlebars to look inside a folder called navbar-one and then to find a file called navbar-light and insert it into the index.html file when it is compiled.</p>         
                    <p>There are a few important notes about our use of Handlebars partials:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All of our partials are stored inside <code class="language-markup">src/partials</code>. Do not place partials anywhere else.</li>
                        <li>We use .html as our partial file extension. We have also added .svg as a valid partial file extension.</li>
                        <li>When you want to include a partial in your HTML page, you only reference the folder name that the partial resides in. If you look at the example partial above, the full filepath would be: <code class="language-markup">src/partials/header/navbars/navbar-one/navbar-light.html</code>. Note that you only need the parent directory, not the full filepath.</li>
                        <li>Do not include the partial file extension. Note in the example above that we output "navbar-light" and not "navbar-light.html"</li>
                    </ul>  
                    
                    <h4>Handlebars Loop</h4>
                    <p>Let's look at how we use Handlebars to keep our code base clean. Open up any of our category pages: <code class="language-markup">src/html/shop-category.html</code>. Now, if we require a custom layout for that particular category page (say we wanted a banner between listing items), we can't use a loop. So you may have to open up the other category template files. They are always named the same with "-two" or "-three" at the end of the filename.</p>
                    <p>If you look around the category page code, you will find this example:</p>
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                            \{{#each category-three.entries}}
                                <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                                    \{{> listing-cards/listing-card-one this }}
                                </div>
                            \{{/each}}                
                    </script>
                    <p>And that's our loop for a category page. It's as simple as it appears. You might have to first read the "Template Data" section of these helpdocs to better understand this code: <code class="language-markup">category-three.entries</code> but we're passing in JSON data to our Handlebars loop, then inside the loop we are referencing a Handlebars partial and passing it the data for each loop item: </p>       
                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-markup markup-block">
                                \{{> listing-cards/listing-card-one this }}               
                    </script>   
                    <p>If we didn't use the loop above, you would find the same HTML code repeated over and over for your category listing page - or any page where we need to output a large amount of similar HTML code.</p>
